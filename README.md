Recently a full featured maritime alarm monitoring system implementing (hardware and software all from scratch) was referred to me.
As an onboard electrical technician, I am aware of how complex it supposed to be.
In one of my attends I had encountered a very old and bad (in term of overall engineering and design) one, from a chinese company called Rongde.
Its peripherals for DAQ were in ASCII, Watch cabin units were in ASCII, Voyage data recorde were in ASCII. No error detections and no error rectifications.
Somehow I accessed its project source for V5.0.0. (Hardware equipment are still providable. 2017 marking was visually inspectable) It was written in Visual Basic 6 and all ASCII to other DataType convertors were written next to its files. They were not uploaded.
Also note that I removed the old graphic-constructor lines on beginning of all uploaded files. It tought me a lot, hope you enjoy too. I hope it doesn't covered by copyright :) peace/. Pourkascheffsky
